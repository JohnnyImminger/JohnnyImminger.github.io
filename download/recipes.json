Mix everything together and knead to a dough until it is elastic. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes in a warm place (approx. 25 degrees). Knead the dough on a worktop sprinkled with flour again briefly with the balls of your hands. Divide the dough into two halves, cut one half into four small pieces using the dough card. Now 'grind' the bread and roll, i.e. shape it. To do this, roll the four small balls of dough with your hands in a circular motion over the worktop until a tension is created on the surface. On the underside, a kind of spiral is created by the rotating movement. Now form the second large half of the dough into a loaf of bread and place it in a fermentation basket or a box mould with the taut surface facing downwards. Cover and leave to rise again for 30 minutes in a warm place. After half an hour, turn the bread dough over on a baking tray and cut the rolls. Preheat the oven to 220°C and then bake the rolls for about 20 and the bread for about 30 minutes at 200°C top / bottom heat until golden brown. Then cover with a cloth and let it evaporate on a grid. Bon appetite!","requiredTime":120,"amountOfPortions":1}]}
